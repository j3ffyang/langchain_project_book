    <description>This is a new chapter.+++ title = “Preface” type = “Preface” +++&#xA;Preface It is with great pleasure and enthusiasm that I present to you this book on the orchestration of large language models with LangChain. As an experienced Python and LangChain developer, I have had the privilege of participating in numerous projects that revolve around language modeling. These engagements have provided me with invaluable hands-on experience and insight into the complexities and challenges associated with building and managing large language models.</description>
