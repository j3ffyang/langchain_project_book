They essentially act as wrappers for these models, enabling the utilization of their specific functionalities and capabilities. Chain: Chain enables us to integrate multiple components to address a specific task. It streamlines the process of implementing complex applications by enhancing modularity, making debugging and maintenance more straightforward. Document loaders: Document Loaders play a role in loading documents into the LangChain system, managing a range of document types like PDFs, and transforming them into a compatible format for LangChain processing. This procedure encompasses multiple stages, including data ingestion, context comprehension, and refinement. Prompt: Prompts serve as inputs for LLMs to generate specific responses. Crafting effective prompts is vital for obtaining valuable outputs from LLMs. Prompt engineering aims to create prompts that yield precise, relevant, and beneficial responses from LLMs. For instance, the prompt plays an amazing role in the output when examining the prompt in OpenAI’s Sora, which creates stunning and visually striking videos. VectorStore: It brings functions for the effective storage and retrieval of vector embeddings. And it operates as a repository for vectors containing supplementary data, streamlining the processes of storage, search, and point management. Output Parsers: The output_parser converts the output of an LLM into a more appropriate format, especially beneficial when generating structured data using LLMs. Agents: LLMs can communicate with their surroundings through agents. For instance, carrying out a particular task via an external API, or grabbing extra data from outside website. LangChain utilizes a sequential pipeline method to construct tailored applications for LLM. This structured approach integrates diverse services, data inputs, and formatting processes, ensuring accurate processing and consistent output. Modules in LangChain follow a step-by-step process with single inputs and outputs, facilitating smooth data flow. This mechanism simplifies development and enhances LLM utilization. By streamlining workflows, LangChain optimizes AI application development, executing steps in a specific order to real-world processes for managed outcomes.\nLangChain Workflow Having grasped the fundamental elements of LangChain, let’s observe its process in detail and how the message is handled. The actual scenarios can change the workflow’s logic depending on the requirements. A very common conversation flow is shown in Figure 2.2, which includes document_loaders, data embedding into vectorstore, and query similarity_search within RetrievalQA chain, then returns the analyzed result to the user.\nactor user component Load_Docs component Query component LLM_generates_answer package LangChain { component Document_Loaders component CharacterTextSplitter component embeddings component PromptTemplate component RetrievalQA } Load_Docs -\u003e Document_Loaders user -\u003e Query Query -\u003e RetrievalQA Document_Loaders -\u003e CharacterTextSplitter CharacterTextSplitter --\u003e embeddings PromptTemplate \u003c- embeddings PromptTemplate --\u003e RetrievalQA RetrievalQA -\u003e LLM_generates_answer Load_Docs -[hidden]- user Query -[hidden]- LLM_generates_answer Figure 2.2: LangChain Workflow\nLet’s discuss these steps in detail. I’ve included the Python code for a set of typical modules to demonstrate the components. The real projects will be covered in detail in the upcoming chapters. To run the Python code provided, it is required to set up a working environment, a procedure that will be elaborated on in the upcoming chapter. You can directly proceed to the next chapter to configure your development environment, ensuring the necessary libraries are installed and properly set up for the successful execution of the sample code presented here.\ndocument_loaders can load, extract data from diverse sources and transform it into structured documents. It can handle *.txt (plain text) and *.xls (Microsoft Excel), load the HTML content from any website. Here’s an example of loading data from Wikipedia through WebBaseLoader\nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file\") document = loader.load() LangChain uses the TextSplitter class to break down the document into smaller chunks that can be more easily processed by the language model. One of the most used splitters, RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, divides a large text into chunks based on a defined size, using a set of characters. By default, it utilizes characters like [\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \"], and [\"\"]. Initially, it attempts to split the text using “\\n\\n”. If the resulting chunks are still too large, it progresses to the next character, “\\n”, for further splitting. This process continues through the set of characters until a split smaller than the specified chunk size is achieved. The chunk_size parameter controls the max size of the final documents, and the chunk_overlap parameter specifies how much overlap there should be between chunks.\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=50) docs = splitter.split_documents(document) LangChain uses a VectorStore to create embeddings for each document split. These embeddings are numerical representations of the text that can be used for efficient information retrieval. The provided code snippet utilizes the all-mpnet-base-v2 model from HuggingFaceEmbeddings by default. If not explicitly specified, this model is used. Additionally, the code operates with a vector store based on Qdrant, running in memory. (Please be aware that the vector store we have just set up operates in memory, which implies that all data will be lost when your computer is turned off. The advantage of utilizing a memory-based vector store is the ability to swiftly test your code without the need to save it. We will delve into persistent storage for production purposes in upcoming chapters). The collection is named wikipedia in vectorstore.\nfrom langchain_community.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings from langchain_community.vectorstores import Qdrant vectorstore = Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embedding=HuggingFaceEmbeddings(), location=\":memory:\", collection_name=\"wikipedia\", ) # You can print out all parameters of Embeddings # print(HuggingFaceEmbeddings()) Subsequently, the VectorStore is employed to conduct a similarity_search on the document embeddings, aiming to identify the documents most pertinent to the user’s query. The search provides relevance scores for the query and outputs 2 results.\nquery = \"What's flatfile?\" result = vectorstore.similarity_search_with_score(query, k=2) print(result) To make foundation models useful for domain-specific tasks, the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework augments prompts with external data from multiple sources, including document repositories, databases, or APIs. In a later chapter, we will examine how RAG functions in actual projects. For the time being, this is a brief excerpt of RAG code that illustrates how retrieval functions to obtain data from vectorstore using meaning rather than keywords.\nquery = \"What is flatfile?\" retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() print(retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)[0]) The entire code, for instance, looks like this:\nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file\") document = loader.load() from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=50 ) docs = splitter.split_documents(document) from langchain_community.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings from langchain_community.vectorstores import Qdrant vectorstore = Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embedding=HuggingFaceEmbeddings(), location=\":memory:\", collection_name=\"wikipedia\", ) # print(HuggingFaceEmbeddings()) query = \"What's flatfile?\" result = vectorstore.similarity_search_with_score(query, k=2) print(result) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() print(retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)[0]) The above code snippet goes through the following steps to process the document\nLoad a document, and split it into smaller chunks Insert the splitted chunks into VectoreStore, which is configured as running in memory. You may want to persist it in production Create a query, then send it to VectorStore for similarity_search Retrieve the relevant document The flow is straight forward and simple. The code in the previous example follows a fundamental flow, incorporating VectorStore with embeddings but not yet involving LLM. Our next step is to introduce an LLM into the process.",

Ollama, serving as the manager for LLM, operates as a server process within the operating system, such as through systemd on Linux. VectorStore, exemplified by Qdrant in this context and overseen by LangChain, runs on Docker with a dedicated volume for persistent data storage. package langchain { component llm component vectorstore } package operating-system { component docker component ollama database storage } vectorstore -- docker docker - storage llm -- ollama Figure 4.1 Software Architecture\nDocker To store embedded data in the vector database (VectorStore), I will provide guidance on configuring VectorStore in Docker for persistent data storage. Having a vector database in Docker offers the advantage of operating the database independently, allowing it to function as a server accessible to multiple clients. This approach facilitates a smooth transition from Docker to a Kubernetes container environment, ensuring consistent service delivery with system monitoring in a production setting.\nBy the way, having Docker is not mandatory for a vector database. Other options are to run vector database directly on the file system and in memory. The in-memory VectorStore is specifically designed for LangChain application development, as data stored this way is lost upon machine reboot.\nOllama There are several ways to manage the embedding models and large language models (LLM). I want to introduce Ollama, it’s surprisingly simple and straightforward.\nFrom Ollama official documentation, it says:\nOllama is an open-source app that lets you run, create, and share large language models locally with a command-line interface. Learn why running LLMs locally is a game changer, what models Ollama supports, and how to get started with it.\nIts Command Line Interface (CLI) functions similarly to commands like ollama pull llama2, similar to Git and Docker. The server process can be managed using systemd on a Linux system for operational use in production. This server can consistently deliver LLM services without the need to reload the extensive model into memory each time LangChain is invoked.\nYou can install Ollama by following the instruction from https://github.com/ollama/ollama. On Linux, you can manage it by the following commands\nsystemctl status ollama systemctl restart ollama Pull (download) and run the models, for example:\nollama pull mistral ollama pull llama2 ollama run gemma:2b Refer to the official documentation for further details.\nAn important reminder is that the model pulled by Ollama will be stored in /usr/share/ollama.

For example, as demonstrated in the previous chapter using HuggingFaceEndpoint to utilize mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model from Hugging Face platform, you will be required to generate a HuggingFace access token by following up the instruction at https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens . You will be able to find your access token at https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens .\nAfter generating the access token, you can proceed to set up and configure the token within the environment based on the following options.\nSet the environment variable To set the environment variable in the terminal, consider adding the following to ~/.bashrc or a similar file. This approach ensures the access token is available for all projects within your environment. Additionally, I will provide guidance on configuring both the OpenAI API key and Hugging Face’s API token.\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\"sk-YOUR_API_KEY\" export HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=\"hf_YOUR_API_TOKEN\" My preferred way for storing API token is to use environment variables. This way offers both convenience and security outside of your source code. Storing API token directly in code is not recommended due to potential security risks.\nImportant note:\nIt is important to avoid exposing your any secret key to version control, as unauthorized individuals could potentially impersonate you and gain access to your resources on remote platforms.\nYou also have the option to store your access token in a .env file located within your Python code directory. The .env file should look like the following:\nHUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=\"hf_YOUR_API_TOKEN\" Your HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN is also stored at ~/.cache/huggingface/token, on Linux system.\nIn Jupyter notebook or Python code Additionally, you can do this from inside the Jupyter notebook or Python code\nimport os os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"sk-YOUR_API_KEY\" os.environ[\"HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN\"] = \"hf_YOUR_API_TOKEN\" Or\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key=\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") Important note\nWhen pushing code to Github or Gitlab, it is important to prevent sensitive information, such as API keys in .env, from being pushed in public. One way to do this is by setting up a .gitignore file.\nTo enhance your understanding of security measures, I suggest dedicating time to explore the following websites.\nhttps://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python\nCache setup If you have enough computing resources and opt to execute all tasks locally, including loading the LLM and smaller embedding models, all downloaded models will be stored in the default directory on Linux, at ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/.\nThe default directory can be altered either HF_HOME or HF_HUB_CACHE environment variable. Example for Python:\nimport os os.environ['HF_HOME'] = '/PATH/cache/' And example for Bash on Linux: export HF_HOME=/PATH/cache/ At the same time, PyTorch models like sentence-transformers will be stored in the directory ~/.cache/torch.\nHere is an example on my machine with several LLMs installed.\n(gpt) [jeff@manjaro hub]$ pwd /home/jeff/.cache/huggingface/hub (gpt) [jeff@manjaro hub]$ ls codellama-7b-python.Q4_0.gguf gpt4all models--google-bert--bert-base-chinese models--google--flan-t5-small models--gpt2 models--Salesforce--blip-image-captioning-large (gpt) [jeff@manjaro hub]$ du -ksh 13G . This is the location where the embedding and LLM models are downloaded and installed locally. At times, LLM models like Mistral and Falcon can be quite large, with each potentially exceeding 10GB in size.

LangChain aims to develop data-aware and agentic applications that enable language models to communicate with their surroundings and establish connections with other data sources, rather than only calling out to a language model via an API.\nAt the heart of LangChain are two key components. The first one is the modular abstractions provided by LangChain, which are essential for working with language models. These components are designed to be easy to use, whether you use the rest of the LangChain framework or not.\nThe Use-Case Specific Chains make up the second part. These might be conceptualized as putting together the required parts in a certain order to complete a certain use case. These chains are intended to serve as a more advanced interface that makes it simple for users to begin a particular use case. Additionally, they are adaptable, giving you flexibility according to the requirements of the application.\nMoreover, LangChain is context-aware, allowing applications to make decisions depending on the context that is supplied by linking a language model to context-giving sources. Because of this, LangChain is a crucial tool for creating apps that can communicate with language models and make deft choices depending on the environment.\nFrom the high level of LangChain framework, the main components include:\nArchitecture and Workflow Modules and Models Embeddings and VectorStor Chains and Retrievers Technical Requirements To grasp “LangChain Fundamentals”, you’ll need proficiency in Python, including its data science libraries, and a kind of understanding of large language models like LLaMA, Mistral and Gemma. Knowledge of data structures is essential for efficient data processing. Familiarity with machine learning and natural language processing concepts will be beneficial, given LangChain’s focus on language models. Basic understanding of APIs is required for data interactions.\nIn practical projects, deploying a large language model (LLM) as a service typically involves launching it in a Docker container, or Kubernetes. Hence, having familiarity with containers would also be advantageous.\nLangChain is an open-source tool with a Python and JavaScript codebase. However, the examples provided in this guide exclusively focus on Python.\nWhat is LangChain? Imagine a scenario where you have many business reports and you’re scheduled to have a business meeting with your higher management next Monday. However, you have yet to create a summary of these reports. Wouldn’t it be convenient if you could simply ask your text reports to highlight the key points you need to discuss? LangChain is designed to make this task a reality.\nLangChain is an open-source framework designed to help build applications powered by LLMs, like ChatGPT, and create more advanced use cases around LLMs by chaining together different components from several modules.\nLet’s look at some of the features of LangChain:\nIt is an innovative technology that aims to bridge the gap between languages and facilitate communication on a global scale. It leverages artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and natural language processing (NLP) to enable real-time translation and interpretation services, not only human languages, but also programming languages. It can be used to develop intelligent applications, such as chatbots, semantic optimization, text generation and summarization, and programming language translation. It offers endless possibilities for creating powerful applications that harness the capabilities of LLMs. It is an open-source framework that streamlines the development of applications utilizing large language models like OpenAI or Hugging Face. It offers end-to-end chains integration to facilitate working with various programming languages, platforms, and data sources. By leveraging these features, developers can create powerful and innovative applications that leverage the power of language models.\nLangChain is not without its challenges, and there are concerns regarding privacy, accuracy, and potential biases in LangChain. We’ll discuss this later in the book.\nWhat Problem does LangChain Resolve? The goal of LangChain is to address the different issues that arise while developing applications with LLMs. Important problems that LangChain aims to solve include:\nStandardizing prompt structures: By making the prompt structure simpler, LangChain helps developers who collaborate with LLMs to work more efficiently. Innovative open-source projects like Lepton and AutoPrompt, accessible on GitHub, focus to standardize prompt structure metadata to address the issue of Language Models struggling to comprehend prompts. Strengthening integration capabilities: LangChain guarantees the smooth application of LLM outputs among various modules and libraries. Simplifying model switching: With LangChain, developers may quickly move between different LLM models, as well as embedding models for VectorStore, in their applications. I am particularly fond of Quivr, a concept known as the “second brain”, which streamlines prompt editing, facilitates model transitions, connects the front-end with the back-end, and supports ongoing conversations while ensuring user access authentication. Similar services can be discovered on platforms such as Phind.com, Perplexity.ai, and Poe.com, among others. Effective memory management: LangChain helps maintain memory records, e.g. follow-up conversation, as needed while developing applications. Optimizing data handling: LangChain improves overall efficiency by streamlining data management in LLM-driven systems. With its framework, LangChain improves the development process with LLMs by providing tools and features that are tailored to address the typical obstacles that developers face while working with AI and data engineering.",

    "content": "When selecting a language model and an embedding model in LangChain technology, there are several things to consider:\nPrimary Task: Identify the core functions of the language model (LLM), which include tasks like text generation, summarization, translation, and answering queries. A valuable resource to explore these tasks is https://huggingface.co/models covering a wide range from Multimodal to Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Common examples in this context involve Summarization, Text Generation, and Question Answering within NLP.\nModel Size: The size of LLMs can vary significantly, with models ranging from millions to billions of parameters. Larger models typically offer better performance but are also more computationally expensive.\nPre-Trained vs. Fine-Tuned: Fine-tuned models are designed specifically for a given task or domain, whereas pre-trained models are appropriate for a variety of tasks. Based on my practical experience, fine-tuning a custom model in a real project is not as straightforward as anticipated in theory. The objective of fine-tuning is to train a customized model using a base model like Llama2. The main challenge lies in the difficulty of curating a dataset of sufficient quality and quantity, which is not a simple work, to effectively train a domain-specific model. One of my projects entailed training a renowned novel (the dataset comprises all content of the novel and numerous comments carefully chosen for their guaranteed quality) using multiple base models, notably llama2. We dedicated four weeks to curate up to 10,000 question-answer pairs (not enough obviously) before inputting them into the base model for training. Due to the novel-specific nature of these QA pairs, ensuring their accuracy and quality through thorough review proved to be quite time-consuming with a certain level of knowledge required. Unfortunately, the model’s performance post-training fell short of expectations, likely due to our supplied data being buried within the generic framework of the base model, which is typically tailored for broader applications rather than domain-specific tasks. Instead of fine-tuning your own model, I would suggest considering retrieval augmented generation (RAG) due to its advantages in query quality, performance, and task flexibility.\nAccuracy: The model you select should have excellent performance and accuracy. Within this book, I have endeavored to explore and evaluate about 10 distinct open-source language models using LangChain, drawing from my personal experiences across various projects. This approach aims to provide firsthand experience to Language Learning Models (LLMs), encompassing models like Mistral, Llama2, Gemma, Flan, and GPT-2. I will systematically delve into each model with accompanying code examples for a comprehensive understanding.\nIntegration: To facilitate the integration of the model into your current systems, search for an LLM provider that provides user-friendly APIs or SDKs. As an illustration, consider Google’s Gemma model, which was unveiled in early 2024. To explore its integration with Transformers, you can refer to https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-7b?library=true . This resource demonstrates the straightforward process of integrating Gemma into a Python library.\nScalability: The model you select should be able to handle the amount of data you intend to process, especially if you require large-scale real-time responses.\nCost: Understand the pricing model, which could be influenced by factors like token quantity, API usage, or computational hours, as seen in platforms like OpenAI. In this book, the language models employed in this guide will be entirely open source. This means they are technically free to utilize, offering an alternative to services like OpenAI.\nStorage: In terms of storage, options like ElasticSearch, FAISS, or Qdrant can be used based on your specific requirements. FAISS, for example, is fast due to its GPU support but requires you to maintain your metadata information separately in some database with mapping of your FAISS ids. For long documents, it’s useful to split the document into multiple sections if your transformer model has a context length limit (such as 512 tokens), and each section corresponds to its own vector.\nAgain, I will explore the open-source language models featured in this guide, accessible at https://huggingface.co\nIn conclusion, the precise tasks you need to complete, the model’s size, its accuracy, ease of integration, scalability, cost, and the kind of semantic search you’re using will all influence your choice of LLM. It’s worthwhile to regularly visit https://huggingface.co/models to explore its playground and select a model that fits your real-world situation.\nSome Models with My Experience I have been a part of various genuine customer interactions where we delved into discussions regarding the design conversation flow and business situations. The LangChain framework serves as the backbone for crafting project designs, and I’m eager to impart some insights I have gained from these experiences. These lessons, drawn from real-world projects, offer valuable perspectives, such as collecting raw data, choosing appropriate LLMs, customizing prompt(s) and establishing a precise chain to handle communication.\nMistral 7B stands as a cutting-edge 7.3 billion parameter language model, marking a significant leap in the realm of large language models (LLMs). It has surpassed the performance of the 13 billion parameter Llama 2 model across all tasks and excels over the 34 billion parameter Llama 1 on numerous benchmarks. Undoubtedly, this model ranks among the top-tier open-source LLMs I have utilized in LangChain development projects, offering impressive performance while demanding reasonable computational resources (such as a GPU with 16GB memory like an NVIDIA RTX 4090). Its strengths lie in performance, orchestration flexibility, accuracy, competitiveness, and comparison with services like OpenAI. This book primarily showcases code examples focused on the Mistral LLM, conveniently packaged by GPT4All and Ollama for easy use. I love this model.\nFLAN-T5 is a publicly available, extensive language model designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, suitable for commercial applications. Developed by Google researchers towards the end of 2022, this model has undergone fine-tuning across diverse tasks. The T5 model restructures different tasks into a text-to-text framework, encompassing activities like translation, linguistic evaluation, sentence comparison, and document condensation. FLAN represents “Fine-tuned LAnguage Net,” while T-5 stands for “Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer.”\nLlama2: Llama-2 is free to download, but Meta requires a register to grant us access to this model’s family with additional commercial terms. The request is made through a Meta Webpage, which can be accessed from the model homepage on Hugging Face. You can use it as the base to train your own model with fine-tuning.\nGPT-2: The GPT-2 model, a formidable transformer-based language model with 1.5 billion parameters, was trained using a dataset of 8 million web pages. Its primary training goal is to predict the next word by considering all preceding words in a text. The diverse nature of the dataset ensures that this fundamental objective covers genuine instances of numerous tasks across various fields. GPT-2 stands as a notable improvement over its forerunner, GPT, with more than ten times the parameters and trained on over ten times the data volume.\nMiniLM: You can find the details by searching sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2 or sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2 at https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers . It can be used for tasks like clustering embedding or semantic similarity search. Throughout this guide, we will utilize these models for embedding with the VectorStore.\nGemma: a series of cutting-edge open models, is derived from Gemini’s technology. With options of 2 billion and 7 billion parameters, Gemma demonstrates superior performance in language tasks and safety assessments, outperforming competitors in 11 out of 18 text-based tasks. The project prioritizes responsible deployment of LLMs to improve safety and drive innovation. Gemma’s lightweight design and open-source approach position it as a significant advancement in LLMs. We’re going to use gemma-2b model in next chapters. The model can be found at https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2b\nt5-base-finetuned-wikiSQL: I found this one intriguing from Hugging Face and used this model to generate translate user’s instruction in text into SQL. Here’s and give a snippet of code as example: (To run the Python code provided, it is crucial to prepare a functional environment, a process that will be elaborated on in the subsequent chapter. You may find it beneficial to proceed directly to that chapter to set up the necessary environment for running the code.)\nfrom pprint import pprint from dotenv import load_dotenv load_dotenv() from langchain_community.llms import HuggingFaceHub hub_llm = HuggingFaceHub(repo_id=\"mrm8488/t5-base-finetuned-wikiSQL\") from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[\"question\"], template=\"Translate English to SQL: {question}\" ) from langchain.chains import LLMChain hub_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=hub_llm, verbose=True) pprint(hub_chain(\"What is the average age of the respondents using a mobile device?\")) pprint(hub_chain(\"What is the median age of the respondents using a mobile device?\")) The output shows a SQL generated from t5-base-finetuned-wikiSQL model, which is fine-tuned from Google’s T5\n\u003e Entering new LLMChain chain...

To understand GPT4All better, you can get more information from https://gpt4all.io. We just download the model from GPT4All and utilize it with LangChain. The model can be downloaded onto anywhere on your computer and it’s operating system independent.\nBefore we dive into GPT4All, we’d need to understand GGUF.\nGGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format), introduced as a successor to GGML (GPT-Generated Model Language), was released on August 21, 2023. This format represents a significant advancement in the field of language model file formats, enabling enhanced storage and processing of large language models like GPT. Developed by contributors from the AI community, including Georgi Gerganov, the creator of GGML, the creation of GGUF aligns with the needs of large-scale AI models, though it appears to be an independent effort. Its use in contexts involving Facebook’s (Meta’s) LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) models underscores its importance in the AI landscape.\nFor more information about GGUF, you may check at https://deci.ai/blog/ggml-vs-gguf-comparing-formats-amp-top-5-methods-for-running-gguf-files/\nInstall GPT4All in the Environment pip install gpt4all Download the Model Visit https://gpt4all.io and download mistral-7b-openorca.gguf2.Q4_0.gguf under “Model Explorer”.

Tokens are streamed through the callback manager. llm(\"Once upon a time, \", callbacks=callbacks) From the provided example, we can see that:\nThe Mistral language model is managed by GPT4All. We utilize LangChain in conjunction with the GPT4All library to manage the language model, which appears straightforward, akin to the simplicity of Ollama as introduced in the previous chapter. GPT4All also offers a range of other significant LLMs, which can be discovered and downloaded from its official website.\nReminder: The Large Language Models (LLMs) included with GPT4All and Ollama are quantized, which implies that the model size has been reduced at the expense of performance. For businesses that prioritize quality, it is advisable to opt for non-quantized LLMs, such as mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 at https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2\nI will continue to use Ollama and GPT4All for managing the LLM as it is both simple and straightforward for development purposes. Meanwhile, I will provide sample code to run a non-quantized LLM. Obviously, the non-quantized LLM requires a certain amount of capacity in the environment.\nRun the Full Model (non-quantized) Locally without GPT4All If you do have enough capacity, you can try this code snippet to define your own LLM which is running locally, using huggingface_pipeline\nfrom langchain_community.llms.huggingface_pipeline import HuggingFacePipeline from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, pipeline model_id = \"mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2\" tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id) model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id) pipe = pipeline(\"text-generation\", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, max_new_tokens=10) llm = HuggingFacePipeline(pipeline=pipe) Reference \u003e https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/huggingface_pipelines/\nLeverage the LLM Remotely If you do not have an environment with enough capacity, you can simply leverage free API on Hugging Face, with HuggingFaceEndpoint class.

    "content": "LLM Settings When working with prompts, you can communicate directly or through an API with the LLM. A few parameters can be set to get different outcomes for your prompts.\ntemperature: In other words, results are more deterministic when the temperature is lower because the next most likely token is always selected. A higher temperature may cause more unpredictability, which promotes more varied or imaginative results. In essence, you are making the other potential tokens heavier. In order toTo encourage more factual and succinct responses, you might want to apply a lower temperature value for tasks like fact-based quality assurance. It could be useful to raise the temperature value for writing poems or other creative tasks. The impact of adjusting this value can vary significantly based on the settings of the pre-trained model. Hence, it is advisable to experiment with and fine-tune this parameter according to the specific models to align with your requirements.\ntop_k: In text generation, a language model predicts the next word by analyzing preceding words. While one common method involves choosing the word with the highest probability, known as “greedy decoding,” it can lead to repetitive and incoherent text. This is where sampling methods such as Top-K sampling offer a solution. Top-K sampling simplifies the process by restricting the selection to the K most probable next words from the vocabulary, allowing for more varied and coherent text generation.\ntop_p: Top-K sampling limits the selection to the K most probable next words, whereas Top-P sampling, also referred to as “nucleus sampling,” introduces a different approach. Rather than defining a fixed number of top candidates (K), it involves setting a probability mass (P) and sampling exclusively from the smallest subset of words with a combined probability exceeding P. max_length: By changing the max_length, you can control how many tokens the model produces. You can avoid lengthy or irrelevant responses and keep costs under control by setting a maximum length.\nmax_new_tokens: The maximum numbers of tokens to generate, ignoring the number of tokens in the prompt.\nThe above are the default parameters in settings that we use for our projects. We’ll go through them in real code later in this book.\nLLM Limitations While LLMs in LangChain technology have many advantages, they also come with several limitations:\nComputational Resources: Training LLMs require significant computational resources, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Even smaller models can take days or weeks to train on powerful hardware. Data Requirement: LLMs require large amounts of diverse and high-quality data for training. Gathering such data can be challenging, and biases in the training data can lead to biased model outputs. This obstacle poses a significant challenge in my practical experience, hindering the fine-tuning of my domain-specific model and dissuading me from training my own model. Model Interpretability: LLMs are often seen as “black boxes” because their internal workings are complex and not easily understood. This makes it difficult to diagnose and fix issues when the model produces incorrect or unexpected results. It is anticipated that a growing number of open-source LLMs will be introduced within the community to offer enhanced domain-specific capabilities and greater control over data processing workflows. Adaptability: While LLMs are good at general tasks, they may not perform well in specific domains without fine-tuning. Fine-tuning itself can be tricky and requires domain-specific data. In my personal experience, every client I work with demands industry-specific solutions and robust data security measures. Addressing these requirements entails incorporating extensive additional knowledge into project design and implementation, which can pose a challenge for enterprises looking to integrate generative AI within certain industries. Ethical Concerns: LLMs can generate inappropriate or offensive content if not properly controlled. They might also inadvertently leak sensitive information if they were trained on such data. Dependency on Language: LLMs perform best on languages with a large amount of available training data, typically English. Performance might degrade for low-resource languages. A notable advantage I discovered is the ease with which LLMs handle language translation without the need for complex configurations. In my experience, we experimented with utilizing a pure English LLM to generate responses directly, rather than employing language-specific models for non-English languages and then translating as needed, all while customizing prompt instructions. Limitations in Understanding: While LLMs can generate human-like text, they actually don’t understand the content they’re generating. They can’t make logical inferences outside of their training data or handle tasks that require common sense. Environmental Impact: The energy consumption for training LLMs can be substantial, leading to a significant carbon footprint. In conclusion, while LLMs are powerful tools in LangChain technology, they do come with their own set of challenges. It’s crucial to be aware of these limitations when implementing and using these models in real case.",

    "content": "We will introduce Supabase as a vector store and walk through the process of storing various embeddings in Supabase Vector, a combination of PostgreSQL and pgVector, aimed at facilitating semantic search.\nSupabase, an open-source alternative to Firebase, is constructed atop PostgreSQL, a robust SQL database suitable for production environments. Given that Supabase Vector is built on pgVector, it allows for the storage of embeddings alongside other application data within the same database. This integration with pgvector’s indexing algorithms ensures that vector searches remain efficient even at large scales.\nSupabase further enhances app development by offering a range of services and tools, including an auto-generated REST API, to streamline the storage and querying of embeddings within PostgreSQL. Additionally, Supabase provides a user-friendly interface that simplifies the interaction with SQL editors and database components, making it easier to manage and manipulate data.\nOur goal in this business case is to utilize Supabase as a vector store, focusing on the following objectives:\nLeverage the open-source nature of PostgreSQL with the vector extension for efficient vector storage. Manage both data and extensions seamlessly within the Supabase UI, ensuring ease of use and control. Ensure vector data is stored persistently, maintaining integrity and availability for future use. Integrate with LangChain. Installing Self-Hosting with Docker There are multiple methods to install Supabase, and we will focus on self-hosting with Docker. Alternatively, you can opt for the Supabase online service, eliminating the need to manage its infrastructure yourself.\nOne of the advantages of self-hosting Supabase is the assurance of persistent local storage for all data, ensuring that queries and responses remain within your private network for enhanced security.\nLet’s assume that you already have had git and docker installed and configured properly.\n# Get the code git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/supabase/supabase # Go to the docker folder cd supabase/docker # Copy the fake env vars cp .env.example .env # Pull the latest images docker compose pull # Start the services (in detached mode) docker compose up -d It may take a while to download the images within your Docker environment. When it’s done, the output looks like this.\n[+] Running 12/13 ⠴ Network supabase_default Created 19.6s ✔ Container supabase-imgproxy Started 1.1s ✔ Container supabase-vector Healthy 6.4s ✔ Container supabase-db Healthy 12.1s ✔ Container supabase-analytics Healthy 17.8s ✔ Container supabase-auth Started 18.7s ✔ Container supabase-meta Started 18.5s ✔ Container supabase-edge-functions Started 18.7s ✔ Container realtime-dev.supabase-realtime Started 18.5s ✔ Container supabase-studio Started 18.9s ✔ Container supabase-kong Started 18.5s ✔ Container supabase-rest Started 18.1s ✔ Container supabase-storage Started 18.9s For more information about self-hosting install, here’s the official documentation\nReference \u003e https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker#accessing-supabase-dashboard\nConfiguring Vector for Embedding It’s important to note that when using the sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2 embedding model, the dimensionality of the embedding vector is 384. This detail must be considered when changing the embedding model, as it affects the configuration of the vector database with Supabase.\nAfter all Docker containers have been fully created and launched, you can access the Supabase portal at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. The default user ID and password can be found in supabase/docker/.env.\nDASHBOARD_USERNAME=supabase DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=this_password_is_insecure_and_should_be_updated It is strongly recommended to change these default values for security reasons, especially if running in a production environment.\nPlease be aware that if you modify these values in the supabase/docker/.env file, you must restart all the containers to apply the updates. This can be done using the following commands:\ncd supabase/docker docker compose down docker compose up -d Security Warning: The IP address on port 8000 is intended to be accessible from anywhere on the network. Therefore, it is not advisable to expose this directly to the internet without first setting up a proper firewall configuration.\nAfter you successfully log into the portal, you can see\nFigure 6.2 Supabase Dashboard\nSelect SQL Editor from navigation panel, copy and paste the following SQL into SQL Query, then click Run. The SQL code creates an extension of vector and a table called documents which will be used to store the embedded documents.\n-- Enable the pgvector extension to work with embedding vectors create extension if not exists vector; -- Create a table to store your documents create table documents ( id uuid primary key, content text, -- corresponds to Document.pageContent metadata jsonb, -- corresponds to Document.metadata embedding vector (384) -- 384 works for Sentence-Transformers embeddings, change if needed ); -- Create a function to search for documents create function match_documents ( query_embedding vector (384), filter jsonb default '{}' ) returns table ( id uuid, content text, metadata jsonb, similarity float ) language plpgsql as $$ #variable_conflict use_column begin return query select id, content, metadata, 1 - (documents.embedding \u003c=\u003e query_embedding) as similarity from documents where metadata @\u003e filter order by documents.embedding \u003c=\u003e query_embedding; end; $$; Note: Since we are utilizing the sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual model for embeddings, it is necessary to set the “embedding vector” value to 384.\nIf you need to switch to OpenAI’s embedding model, you’ll have to specify the vector value. Here’s an example:\nALTER TABLE documents ALTER COLUMN embedding TYPE vector(1536); Upon completion of the execution, you will discover a database named “documents” under “Database” and an extension named “vector” located under “Extensions.”\nFor detailed documentation of LangChain with Supabase, you may want to check\nReference \u003e https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/supabase/\nOn macOS, you may experience an issue where the containers supabase-meta and supabase-studio continuously restart. This problem can be resolved by disabling the “Use Virtualization Framework” option and changing the file sharing implementation from “VirtioFS” to “gRPC FUSE”. This solution applies to Docker Desktop version v4.29.0.\nSettings \u003e General \u003e Use Virtualization framework \u003e select “gRPC FUSE” then un-check “Use Virtualization framework”\nFigure 6.3 Change Virtualization framework for Supabase on macOS\nReference \u003e https://github.com/supabase/cli/issues/1724\nAccessing the APIs Upon completing the Supabase configuration, it’s necessary to identify the API service key for LangChain, which will be responsible for managing Supabase as the vector store. This key can be found in the section of ANON_KEY.\ncd supabase/docker cat .env The ANON_KEY is API service key.\n############ # Secrets # YOU MUST CHANGE THESE BEFORE GOING INTO PRODUCTION ############ POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-super-secret-and-long-postgres-password JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-token-with-at-least-32-characters-long ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyAgCiAgICAicm9sZSI6ICJhbm9uIiwKICAgICJpc3MiOiAic3VwYWJhc2UtZGVtbyIsCiAgICAiaWF0IjogMTY0MTc2OTIwMCwKICAgICJleHAiOiAxNzk5NTM1NjAwCn0.dc_X5iR_VP_qT0zsiyj_I_OZ2T9FtRU2BBNWN8Bu4GE SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyAgCiAgICAicm9sZSI6ICJzZXJ2aWNlX3JvbGUiLAogICAgImlzcyI6ICJzdXBhYmFzZS1kZW1vIiwKICAgICJpYXQiOiAxNjQxNzY5MjAwLAogICAgImV4cCI6IDE3OTk1MzU2MDAKfQ.DaYlNEoUrrEn2Ig7tqibS-PHK5vgusbcbo7X36XVt4Q DASHBOARD_USERNAME=supabase DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=this_password_is_insecure_and_should_be_updated Security Warning: the API key and password used here are default values without any modifications.

Until the chunks get tiny enough, it tries to divide them sequentially. Specifically, for RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, list [\"\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \", \"\"] is the default. Because paragraphs and sentences are generally thought to be the strongest semantically related parts of text, this has the effect of striving to keep all of them together for as long as possible. You can use the document as a reference to view further TextSplitter functions that are accessible \u003e https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers\n## Split the documents into chunks from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200) docs = splitter.split_documents(documents) Specify the embedding model from langchain_community.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings( model_name=\"sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2\") # model_name=\"bert-base-multilingual-cased\") Numerical machine learning representations of the semantics of the input data are called embeddings. They convert complicated, high-dimensional data, such as text, photos, or audio, into vectors that represent their meaning. Enabling more effective data processing and analysis using algorithms.\nSince we are utilising an open-source embedding model that can be deployed locally, we can freely set the token’s chunk_size to a greater amount.\nThe paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2 model, requiring 477MB of disc space, is the one I like to use. It is compact, strong, and capable. I also include bert-base-multilingual-cased embedding model as reference, which I used for production as well.\nall-MiniLM-L6-v2 is an additional embedding model that I can suggest for testing while developing an application.

It employs Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms for searching with query vectors. Vectors represent data in a high-dimensional space, with each dimension corresponding to a feature. They are used for various data types and can be computed using machine learning methods. Vector databases support tasks like similarity search, multi-modal search, and large language models. They are also integral to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enhancing domain-specific responses of large language models by querying relevant documents based on user prompts.\n## Configure Qdrant client, and define vectorstore and retriever from qdrant_client import QdrantClient from langchain_community.vectorstores import Qdrant url = \"http://127.0.0.1:6333\" vectorstore = Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embedding, url=url, # prefer_grpc=True, collection_name=\"worldhistory\", ) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() In this code snippet, I am utilizing the Qdrant vector database, which is launched via Docker, with persistent data storage located at /$DIR/qdrant_storage.\nFurther elaboration on these open-source alternatives to VectorStore will be provided in upcoming chapters. Additional options include FAISS, Chroma and Pinecone, the latter of which boasts excellent documentation from my personal perspective.\nReminder: re-executing Qdrant.from_documents will insert the embedded data into the vector database (VectorStore), resulting in duplication of the data. This operation only needs to be run once to insert the chunked documents into the VectorStore.\nYou can find more information about Qdrant at https://qdrant.tech/documentation/quick-start and https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/qdrant .\nConfigure PromptTemplate and Prompt This template is designed for question-answering tasks. The template consists of several placeholders that will be filled in dynamically when the template is used:\n{question}: this placeholder will be replaced with the actual question that the user wants to have answered. {context}: this placeholder will be replaced with the relevant context or information that the language model can use to formulate the answer.\nThe template instructs the language model to use the provided context to answer the question concisely, within a maximum of three sentences. If the language model is unable to provide a definitive answer, it should simply state that it doesn’t know.\nfrom langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate template = \"\"\"You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise. Question: {question} Context: {context} Answer: \"\"\" prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template) For more comprehensive information, I recommend visiting https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/cookbook/prompt_llm_parser.\nPlease be aware that the effectiveness of prompts and their templates can vary significantly across different models. Essentially, the language model (LLM) might not always interpret the prompt and its template as intended. It may be necessary to dedicate some time to experimentation and testing to achieve the desired results.\nLoad Mistral model The following code snippet demonstrates the Ollama, acting as a middleware for Large Language Models (LLMs). It instantiates the Ollama class and specifies the particular LLM to be utilized.\nMy experience with the Mistral language model in real projects has shown it to deliver exceptional semantic optimization capabilities. In our project, we explored and tested approximately 30+ different models, including Gemma, GPT4All and GPT-2, etc, open-sourced from the HuggingFace platform. I’ll cover these in this book.\nTo get mistral model loaded and run, you can execute the following command:\nollama pull mistral ollama run mistral You can check what exact model(s) pulled:\nollama list NAME ID SIZE MODIFIED gemma:2b b50d6c999e59\t1.7 GB\t8 days ago mistral:7b 61e88e884507\t4.1 GB\t2 weeks ago To evaluate the performance and quality of this model through Ollama, let’s proceed with Ollama. Further in this guide, I will introduce additional LLMs directly from LangChain, without the use of Ollama.\nfrom langchain_community.llms import Ollama llm = Ollama(model=\"mistral\") Before executing the code, it’s crucial that Ollama is started. On Linux systems, you can verify and initiate the process\nsystemctl status ollama systemctl restart ollama To initiate the process on macOS, simply click on the Ollama icon that appears after installation.\nEnable debug and verbose mode (optional) from langchain.globals import set_verbose, set_debug set_debug(True) set_verbose(True) Enabling debug and verbose mode can print the detailed chain step by step. It’s essential to debug when having issue.\nStart an RAG Chain An RAG chain is a type of LangChain that combines a retriever (to fetch relevant context) and a language model (to generate the output).\nThe rag_chain is defined using the LangChain’s pipe (|) operator, which allows you to compose multiple components into a single chain.\n{\"context\": retriever, \"question\": RunnablePassthrough()}: This is the first component of the chain, which is a dictionary. The context key is assigned the retriever object, which is likely a component that retrieves relevant context for the given input. The question key is assigned a RunnablePassthrough object, which means the input question will be passed through the chain without modification. | prompt: This component is likely a prompttemplate or a prompt-related component that prepares the input for the language model. | llm: This is the language model component, which will generate the output based on the prepared input. | StrOutputParser(): This is the final component of the chain, which is an output parser that expects the output to be a string. This ensures that the final output of the chain is a string.\n## Create an RAG chain from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser rag_chain = ( {\"context\": retriever, \"question\": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) Start an interactive loop of question and answer This Python code snippet demonstrates a simple interactive loop that allows the user to ask questions and receive responses from the rag_chain defined in the previous code example.\nLet’s break down the code step by step: while True:: This starts an infinite loop that will continue until the user decides to exit. user_input = input(\"Enter your question: \"): This line prompts the user to enter a question, and the user’s input is stored in the user_input variable.\nif user_input == \"exit\":: This checks if the user’s input is the string “exit”. If it is, the loop will be terminated using the break statement.\nelse:: If the user’s input is not “exit”, the code inside the else block will be executed. print(rag_chain.invoke(user_input)): This line invokes the rag_chain defined in the previous code example, passing the user’s input as the argument. The output of the rag_chain is then printed to the console.\nThe overall flow of this code is as follows:\nThe user is prompted to enter a question. If the user enters “exit”, the loop is terminated, and the program ends. If the user enters any other input, the rag_chain is invoked with the user’s input, and the output is printed to the console. The loop then repeats, prompting the user for another question. while True: user_input = input(\"Enter your question: \") if user_input == \"exit\": break else: print(rag_chain.invoke(user_input)) The output is like the following with the detailed chains’ information Remember, you must copy one or more PDF documents into the loading directory.\n100%|███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 1/1 [00:06\u003c00:00, 6.58s/it] Enter your question: tell me about the history of italy Italy's history includes a final war for unity over the Italian peninsula in 91 BC, which ended with Roman citizenship decree for all Italians. The classical Latin language emerged around this time and held sway for about 300 years. In the Middle Ages, northern Italy was subject to German rule while southern Italy and Sicily prospered under the Normans, who allowed free choice of religion. Frederick II, grandson of Frederick Barbarossa and Norman Roger II, became emperor of Rome in 1220, dividing his time between managing affairs in both Italy and Germany, and founding the University of Naples and enlarging the medical school at Salerno. Eastern and southern Italy remained Byzantine in culture, while the rest of the peninsula developed a new civilization, language, religion, and art from its Roman heritage.

It can be a statement, command, or question that dictates how the AI should process input data. For instance, instructions like “Translate this English text to French” or “Summarize the article” shape the model’s output. Crafting precise prompts significantly impacts the quality of an LLM’s results. My personal experience in LLM development reveals that output quality varies based on prompt quality, as each LLM has its preferred prompt format and template. Hence, the potential for standardizing prompts and prompt templates in metadata before adapting them to an LLM presents an innovative opportunity, such as Lepton and AutoPrompt open-source projects that I mentioned earlier. I aspire to delve deeper into this area through further research.\nContext: Context offers relevant background details to steer the model’s response, aiding in specific situational, topical, or domain-related prompts. For example, in chatbot interactions, context encompasses prior messages. In machine translation, it includes surrounding text. In practice, maintaining a completely private context ensures that similarity search outputs from a local LLM remain private and secure.\nQuestion: The question is the specific query or input data that we want the model to respond to. It’s the focus of the prompt and is typically what you want the model to process and generate a response for. The question should be clear and concise to ensure the model can understand and accurately respond to it.\nAnswer: The answer (or output, or result) is the response generated by the model based on the instruction, context, and question. The format and type of answer can be guided by an output indicator, which specifies the kind of response expected from the model. For instance, an output indicator might specify that the answer should be a list of items, a single word, or a full sentence.\nEach of these components plays a vital role in shaping the model’s response, and their effective use can greatly enhance the model’s performance on a wide range of tasks. However, it is important to note that not all components are required for every prompt, and the format of the prompt can vary depending on the task at hand.\nHere’s an example of defining prompt in ChatPromptTemplate class in LangChain. To augment the prompt by incorporating extra context, it is essential to create a prompt template. This template allows for easy customization of the prompt, as illustrated below.\nfrom langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate template = \"\"\"You are an assistant for question-answering tasks.

An explanation from its official documentation:\n… FAISS, a library that allows us to quickly search for multimedia documents that are similar to each other - a challenge where traditional query search engines fall short. We’ve built nearest-neighbor search implementations for billion-scale data sets that are some 8.5x faster than the previous reported state-of-the-art, along with the fastest k-selection algorithm on the GPU known in the literature. This lets us break some records, including the first k-nearest-neighbor graph constructed on 1 billion high-dimensional vectors.\nTraditional databases consist of structured tables filled with symbolic data. For instance, an image collection would be organized into a table with each photo represented by a row, containing details like an image ID and descriptive text. These rows can also connect to entries from other tables, such as linking an image with people to a table of names.\nAI tools, including text embedding methods like word2vec or convolutional neural network (CNN) descriptors trained with deep learning, generate high-dimensional vectors. These vectors offer a more potent and adaptable representation compared to fixed symbolic representations. However, traditional databases designed for SQL queries are not equipped to handle these new vector representations. The sheer volume of new multimedia content generates billions of vectors, and more critically, identifying similar entries involves finding similar high-dimensional vectors, a task that is inefficient and often impossible with conventional query languages.\nLet’s install FAISS and its dependencies.\npip install -U langchain-community faiss-cpu langchain-openai tiktoken Then define an embedding model using paraphrase-multilingual_MiniLM\nfrom langchain_community.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings embedding = HuggingFaceEmbeddings( model_name=\"sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2\") Use FAISS.from_documents to insert the embedded document into FAISS vectorstore. Then define retriever\nfrom langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(data, embedding) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() The last line of code snippet converts the vectorstore into a retriever class. This allows us to easily use it in other LangChain methods, which largely work with retrievers.\nCompressed Retriever In our project, we found that:\nThe LLM generates a predicted result if the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) cannot find an existing answer from similarity_search. Or the retrieved documents contain too much irrelevant information and are distracting the LLM. This is unacceptable when proposing such a solution to our customers. Technically, if the vector database does not have a relative output, it should indicate that it does not know, without causing confusion with predictions made by the LLM.\nOften, the most relevant information for a query may be buried within documents containing a significant amount of irrelevant text. Passing the full document (or spreadsheet, and CSV) through your application can lead to more expensive LLM calls and poorer responses.\nContextual compression is a solution to this problem. The idea is simple: instead of immediately returning the retrieved documents as-is, you can compress them using the context of the given query, ensuring that only the relevant information is returned. “Compressing” here refers to both reducing the contents of individual documents and filtering out documents entirely.\nTo use the Contextual Compression Retriever, you’ll need:\nA Base Retriever A Context Compressor The Contextual Compression Retriever passes queries to the base retriever, takes the initial documents, and then passes them through the Context Compressor. The Context Compressor then shortens the list of documents by reducing their contents or dropping them altogether.\nReference \u003e https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/contextual_compression/\nHere’s an example:\nrectangle ContextualCompressionRetriever { file base_retriever file base_compressor } file compression_retriever note bottom of compression_retriever: new retriever, used in chain base_retriever -\u003e base_compressor ContextualCompressionRetriever -\u003e compression_retriever Figure 5.3 Contextual Compression Retriever logic\nfrom langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(documents, embeddings) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() from langchain.retrievers.contextual_compression import ContextualCompressionRetriever from langchain.retrievers.document_compressors import LLMChainExtractor compressor = LLMChainExtractor.from_llm(llm) compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever( base_compressor=compressor, base_retriever=retriever ) ## you can query with similar_search # compressed_docs = compression_retriever.get_relevant_documents(query) Fix Hallucination with RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain While we cannot entirely safeguard ourselves from convincing yet false hallucinations generated by the language model, it’s important to acknowledge that such occurrences are possible and that it’s unlikely we can completely eliminate this issue. However, we can enhance our confidence in the responses provided by incorporating citations into the answers. This can be achieved by utilizing a variant of the RetrievalQA chain, known as RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain, which allows users to trace the origin of the information.\n# from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA # chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=llm, retriever=compression_retriever) from langchain.chains import RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain chain = RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain.from_chain_type( llm=llm, retriever=compression_retriever ) pprint(chain.invoke(query))",

    "content": "In LangChain, a Python library designed to simplify the process of building Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications using LLMs, embeddings and VectorStore play a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of these applications.\nUnderstanding Embeddings In the realm of LLMs, embeddings serve as numeric depictions of words, phrases, or sentences, encapsulating their semantic meaning and context. These embeddings facilitate text representation in a machine-learning-friendly format, supporting a range of NLP endeavors. Commonly pretrained on vast text datasets, embeddings such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText capture semantic connections and resemblances among words. By converting words into vectors, these embeddings streamline tasks like text analysis and generation, empowering models to comprehend and handle language proficiently by leveraging contextual cues.\nI recommend dedicating some time to review an insightful document authored by Sascha Metzger, which elaborates on tokens, vectors, and embeddings in the field of natural language processing. The document can be accessed at https://saschametzger.com/blog/what-are-tokens-vectors-and-embeddings-how-do-you-create-them .\nIn the context of an LLM with LangChain, embeddings are used to capture the “meaning” of text. The closeness of two vectors indicates the degree of correlation between them, where shorter distances imply a stronger correlation, and longer distances suggest a weaker correlation.\nHere is an example of how to create vector embeddings using the sentence_transformers library in Python: In this example, embeddings.embed_query(text) generates embeddings for the given text.\n# load embedding library from langchain_community.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings # define embedding with using sentence-transformers model from HuggingFace.co embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings( model_name=\"sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2\" ) text = \"harry potter’s owl is in the castle.\" # embed the given text embed_text = embeddings.embed_query(text) # print the first 3 embedding print(embed_text [:3]) # print out the type of embeddings print(type(embed_text)) The model utilized in this instance is the paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM from sentence-transformers, known for its resilience, efficiency, and compact size of 477MB for local storage. Despite various alternatives, this model is favored for its simplicity and effectiveness. Following the embedding procedure, the embedded data is going to be inserted into VectorStore, ensuring long-term persistence and readiness for subsequent similarity-search operations.\nUnderstanding VectorStore Understanding a VectorStore involves grasping its role in efficiently searching and comparing extensive sets of vectors, which are essential for AI applications by translating words into numerical representations to simplify sentence comparisons based on their semantic meanings.\nFunctionality of VectorStore: In LangChain, the VectorStore serves as a repository for embeddings, enabling streamlined searches based on semantic similarity. Text undergoes embedding and is then stored in the VectorStore for long-term retention, preparing it for subsequent similarity inquiries.\nVariety of VectorStore options: LangChain offers support for vector databases as its primary index type, encompassing features like document loaders, text splitters, VectorStores , and retrievers. These databases contain individual nodes alongside their respective embeddings within a VectorStore.\nBenefits of utilizing VectorStore: Integrating VectorStore in LangChain provides advantages such as efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings, facilitating quick and accurate similarity searches rooted in semantic relationships. By storing embeddings close to domain-specific datasets, seamless integration with additional metadata is enabled without external queries.\nI will be presenting a variety of open-source VectorStores. Among the most popular in the LLM domain are FAISS, Qdrant, Pinecone, and Chroma. Each of these open-source vectorstore databases will be explored through sample code within this book.\nUtilizing Embedding and VectorStore in LangChain In LangChain, embedding and VectorStore collaboratively foster the creation of intelligent agents capable of interpreting and implementing human language commands. Initially, textual data is subjected to processing and transformation into embeddings via appropriate models. Subsequently, these embeddings are deposited in a VectorStore for expeditious retrieval.\nUpon receipt of novel instructions or queries, the system may rapidly extract pertinent embeddings from the VectorStore, contrast them against the embeddings derived from the incoming command, and subsequently formulate a reply.\nBelow is an example of how this might manifest in code, employing the Sentence-Transformers library for embeddings and inserting the embeddings into FAISS open-source VectorStore, which is running in memory.\n# load embedding model from langchain_community.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings embedding = HuggingFaceEmbeddings( model_name=\"sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2\" ) # load vectorstore library from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS # insert the embedded data into vectorstore in memory vectorstore = FAISS.from_texts( [\"harry potter's owl is in the castle\"], embedding = embedding, ) print(vectorstore) Once the embedded data is stored in VectorStore, we will explore the process of orchestrating retrieval and chaining to obtain responses from the LLM.",

We will examine two fundamental ideas in LangChain in this chapter: Chain and Retriever.\nUnderstanding Chains LangChain relies heavily on chains. The core of LangChain’s operation is these logical relationships among one or more LLMs. Depending on the requirements and LLMs involved, chains might be simple or complex. An LLM model, an output parser that is optional, and a PromptTemplate are all part of its organized configuration. The LLMChain in this configuration takes in a variety of input parameters. It converts these inputs into a logical prompt by using the PromptTemplate. The model is then fed this polished cue. Following receipt of the output, the LLMChain formats and further refines the result into its most useable form using the OutputParser, if one is supplied.\nfolder chain { artifact input_variables artifact PromptTemplate artifact LLM } input_variables -\u003e PromptTemplate PromptTemplate -\u003e LLM folder prompt { artifact \"prompt = PromptTemplate(\\n input_variables=[\"city\"],\\n template=\"Describe a perfect day in {city}?\"\\n)\" } folder chain.invoke { artifact \"chain = LLMChain(\\n llm=llm, prompt=prompt\\n)\\nprint(chain.invoke(\"Paris\"))\" } chain -[hidden]- prompt prompt -[hidden] chain.invoke Figure 2.4: Chain in Process\nTo demonstrate LangChain’s capability for creating simple chains, here is an instance utilizing the HuggingFaceEndpoint class.\nFirst the code imports PromptTemplate from langchain.prompts and defines a prompt using the template “Describe a perfect day in {city}?” where {city} is a variable placeholder. It imports an LLM from Hugging Face using HuggingFaceEndpoint, specifying the model repository id as mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct and setting model parameters like temperature and max_new_token. Then the code imports LLMChain from langchain.chains and creates a chain (llmchain) by combining the selected LLM (mistral) and the defined prompt. Finally, it invokes the chain with a query “Paris” using llmchain.invoke(\"Paris\") and prints out the result.\n(TL;DR\nConsider reading the following chapter to efficiently configure your environment for running the provided code examples.)\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[\"city\"], template=\"Describe a perfect day in {city}?\") from langchain_community.llms import HuggingFaceEndpoint repo_id = \"mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2\" llm = HuggingFaceEndpoint( repo_id=repo_id, max_new_tokens=250, temperature=0.5 ) from langchain.chains import LLMChain llmchain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True) print(llmchain.invoke(\"Paris\")) In summary, this code sets up a scenario where an LLM model is prompted to describe a perfect day in Paris based on the defined template and model settings.

Finally, I would\"} Next, we will delve into employing a retriever to fetch data from an established VectorStore. This process ensures that the retrieved data originates exclusively from the designated VectorStore source. When both the LLM and VectorStore reside within a private network, all information involved in retrieval and result generation remains secure and private. Such practices effectively address security and privacy considerations within enterprise environments.\nUnderstanding Retrievers In LangChain, a retriever acts as a pivotal component responsible for fetching relevant information from a knowledge base or content source in response to user queries.\nRAG, short for Retrieval Augmented Generation, is a method employed to integrate additional, often confidential or current data into the knowledge of LLMs. While LLMs demonstrate proficiency in analyzing diverse subjects, their expertise is limited to publicly accessible data present during their training phase. To enable AI applications to reason over private or post-training data effectively, it is imperative to supply the model with precise information to expand its knowledge. RAG entails retrieving pertinent data and seamlessly incorporating it into the model prompt.\nUtilizing Chains and Retrievers in LangChain Combining chains and retrievers in LangChain allows for the creation of intricate workflows that process user input, obtain pertinent data, and produce output.\nWhen a new question is received, the chain can be utilized to process it, produce a prompt, and use the retriever to get relevant data from the knowledge base. A response can then be produced using the information that was retrieved.\nThe following diagram outlines the intricate process:\nInitially, load the document, then split and embed it in a vectorstore, which serves as the retriever for subsequent retrieval in the RAG step.\nUtilize the HuggingFacePipeline to load the Transformers language model for embedding.\nMerge the steps with a customizable prompt to create a chain structure, typically followed by inclusion in the chain using the RunnablePassthrough class to generate the answer.\nfolder documents { artifact document_loaders artifact text_splitter } folder retrievers { artifact embeddings artifact vectorstore artifact retriever } folder rag_chain { artifact RunnablePassthrough folder prompt_template { artifact prompt } folder llm { artifact HuggingFaceEndpoint } } file answer document_loaders -\u003e text_splitter text_splitter --\u003e embeddings embeddings -\u003e vectorstore vectorstore -\u003e retriever retriever -[hidden]- rag_chain retriever --\u003e RunnablePassthrough RunnablePassthrough -\u003e prompt prompt --\u003e HuggingFaceEndpoint HuggingFaceEndpoint -\u003e answer Figure 2.5: Chain of RAG\nIn conclusion, LangChain’s chains and retrievers offer an adaptable and potent approach to developing LLM-based applications. These tools enable developers to design intricate processes that manage user input, obtain relevant data, and provide output.\nHere is an example of how to use a retriever in LangChain. In this example, the code performs the following steps:\nUtilizes a sentence-transformers embedding model to embed data fetched from a website, subsequently inserting the embedded data into a FAISS VectorStore.\nRetrieves relevant data from the retriever (the VectorStore) and processes it through a RAG chain using the RunnablePassthrough library to reach the LLM, incorporating a predefined prompt, and generates the answer.\nLet’s go through it step by step.\nLoad a document from the web, through WebBaseLoader class, split it into small chunks\nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader(\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Hans_Andersen%27s_Fairy_Tales/The_Emperor%27s_New_Clothes\") document = loader.load() from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=200, chunk_overlap=20) chunks = splitter.split_documents(document) Load the embedding model.\nfrom langchain_community.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings embedding = HuggingFaceEmbeddings( model_name=\"sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2\") The from_documents method is used to initialize the FAISS VectorStore with the given chunks and embedding. Subsequently, the code converts this VectorStore into a retriever object using the as_retriever() method.\nfrom langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(chunks, embedding) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() Define prompt with ChatPromptTemplate method.\nfrom langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate template = \"\"\"You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise. Question: {question} Context: {context} Answer: \"\"\" prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template) Use the google/flan-t5-xxl model through the Hugging Face platform’s HuggingFaceEndpoint method remotely. Specify the model’s keyword arguments to customize settings such as temperature and max_new_token. Utilizing HuggingFaceEndpoint allows you to leverage the computational resources provided by Hugging Face, eliminating the need for substantial local computing capacity. You may also experiment with Mistral’s model to observe variations in generation quality.\nfrom langchain_community.llms import HuggingFaceEndpoint repo_id=\"google/flan-t5-xxl\" # repo_id = \"mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2\" llm = HuggingFaceEndpoint( repo_id=repo_id, max_new_tokens=250, temperature=0.5) The RAG chain combines the context retrieved from the retriever, the question, the prompt, and the language model to produce an answer using the RunnablePassthrough method. This chain is both straightforward and engaging in its approach.\nfrom langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser rag_chain = ( {\"context\": retriever, \"question\": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) query = \"What is this story telling about?\" print(rag_chain.invoke(query)) The output will display:\nThe emperor's new clothes The code presented above is straight-forward yet provides a comprehensive, direct, and lucid sequence to manage the entire process:\nExtracting a document from the web, splitting it into smaller parts, and storing them in a VectorStore.\nEstablishing a retriever with the VectorStore.\nTailoring a prompt.\nEmploying an LLM from HuggingFaceEndpoint method.\nIntegrating all the components mentioned above into a coherent chain.",

This step is crucial for filtering out unnecessary data and extracting only the relevant information from the dataset, thereby enhancing the efficiency and speed of our application. Before sending the prompt to the Large Language Model (LLM), we applied these enhancements to ensure that the context is both accurate and contextually rich, thereby improving the overall performance of our response.",

API Document in LangChain LangChain provides an API that enables developers to easily interact with LLM and other computational resources or knowledge sources. This makes it easier to build applications such as question answering systems, chatbots, and intelligent agents.\nI advise you to often check out the latest LangChain API reference, where you may examine incredibly thorough API logic at https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/ .\nDebugging in LangChain Debugging is an important aspect of building applications with LangChain. There are several options that you can enable debug and/ or verbose mode in code.\nThe functions set_debug(True) and set_verbose(True) are utilized to activate debugging and verbose logging, respectively. They allow for logging intermediate stages of components and offering detailed outputs, aiding in the debugging process by printing detailed chains step by step.\nfrom langchain.globals import set_debug, set_verbose set_debug(True) set_verbose(True) CallbackHandlers are objects that implement the CallbackHandler interface, which has a method for each event that can be subscribed to. The CallbackManager will call the appropriate method on each handler when the event is triggered. (credit: this information is from https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/callbacks/). Here’s an example within RetrievalQA function:\nfrom langchain.callbacks import StdOutCallbackHandler retrievalQA = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type( llm=llm, retriever = VectorStoreRetriever(vectorstore=vectorstore), chain_type=\"stuff\", chain_type_kwargs={\"prompt\": PROMPT}, callbacks=[StdOutCallbackHandler()], ) Another one is ConsoleCallbackHandler, which is like StdOutCallbackHandler. Here’s an example which is very straightforward\n# Define an LLM from langchain_community.llms import HuggingFaceEndpoint repo_id = \"mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2\" llm = HuggingFaceEndpoint( repo_id=repo_id, max_new_tokens=250, temperature=0.5) # Define prompt from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\"tell me a joke about {topic}\") # Load output parser for taking output of an LLM from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser output_parser = StrOutputParser() chain = prompt | llm| output_parser # Enable callbacks for logging from langchain.callbacks.tracers import ConsoleCallbackHandler chain.invoke({\"topic\": \"Tintin\"}, config={'callbacks': [ConsoleCallbackHandler()]}) The result will showcase the output in a detailed step-by-step chain format.\nThe debugging features within LangChain simplify the process of pinpointing and resolving issues within your application. Mastering these tools enables you to develop more resilient and effective applications using LangChain. These tools also allow for the detailed printing of each chain step, providing a clear view of how data is processed throughout the workflow.",

What drew us to LangChain was its comprehensive suite of features:\nConfiguring vector databases Orchestrating multiple popular embeddings and large language models from open source community Facilitating complex workflows with agents These capabilities made LangChain an indispensable tool for our development needs.\nWriting Experience During this period, I received an invitation from a renowned UK publisher to author a book about LangChain design and project implementation. Leveraging my hands-on experience, I dedicated nearly six months to crafting this comprehensive guide.\nUnfortunately, despite the effort invested, the book project was ultimately terminated. The reasons cited were a lack of a clear value proposition and insufficient trust in the communication process.\nOpen-Source Initiative Undeterred by this setback, I decided to take a different approach. Recognizing the potential benefits of sharing knowledge within the developer community, I chose to publish my work as open-source material.\nThis decision aligns with the spirit of collaborative innovation that drives many successful tech projects. By making my experiences and insights freely available, I hope to contribute meaningfully to the LangChain ecosystem and support fellow developers in their own journeys.\nCall to Action I invite you to explore these resources and share your thoughts. Your feedback and comments are invaluable in refining and expanding this body of knowledge. Together, we can create a richer understanding of LangChain and its applications.\nFeel free to engage in discussions, ask questions, or suggest improvements, at Github.
