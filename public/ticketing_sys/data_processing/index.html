<p>Based on the data schema outlined, the call log record encompasses various columns, such as the caller&rsquo;s name and the timestamp of the call. These elements are not relevant to the call solution and, consequently, embedding them into a vectorstore can lead to increased computational demands and a decrease in search accuracy. Therefore, it is advisable to focus on embedding only the columns that are important for the end user&rsquo;s query, namely the query itself, the application name, and the relevant solution. These are the key pieces of information that users are interested in retrieving.</p>
<p>Below is a code snippet demonstrating how to extract and embed the three specified columns - <code>query</code>, <code>application</code> name, and <code>solution</code> - from a CSV file.</p>

<p>The output reveals that the <code>page_content</code> of the Document contains information relevant to the solution, including <code>application</code> name, <code>query</code> of the call, and <code>solution</code>, while the <code>ticket_number</code>, <code>date</code>, and <code>caller</code> are categorized under <code>metadata</code>. The <code>page_content</code> will be embedded and then inserted into the vector store. <code>source</code> within <code>metadata</code>, by default, contains the original document name and path, which indicates the source of the information.</p>
