    <title>Preface :: LangChain AI</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/langchain_project_book/preface/index.html</link>
    <description>It is with great pleasure and enthusiasm that I present to you this book on the orchestration of large language models with LangChain. As an experienced Python and LangChain developer, I have had the privilege of participating in numerous projects that revolve around language modeling. These engagements have provided me with invaluable hands-on experience and insight into the complexities and challenges associated with building and managing large language models.&#xA;The goal of this book is to equip you, the reader, with the knowledge and skills necessary to successfully orchestrate large language models using LangChain.</description>
